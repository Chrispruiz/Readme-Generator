# Readme
  
  ## Description: 
  This is a command-line application that generates a high-quality, professional README based on user input.

  * When a user enters a project title, it not only creates the title of the document, but it also makes it the file name.
  * When the user enters a Github Username and Email address, it adds it in the form of a link in the "Questions" section at the bottom of the document.
  * When a user selects a license from the list of options, the application will add a badge of the selected license at the top of the README page, a link that links to the "License" section, and a "License" section that lists the selected license.
  * The README has a working Table of Contents with links that take the user to the corresponding section of the README.
